# M-M_Classifier
This repository includes a basic code for the detection of M&amp;M's using the OpenCV library, as well as a Cascade Classifier used by the program.

If you want to use code - just download both files and make sure you have the OpenCV library installed.
In the python file you will probably need to change the path to the cascade.xml file.
